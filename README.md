# 3DGraphicsJS
3d graphics engine in javascript</br>
This is a pretty simple graphics library in javascript.</br>
Currently it can take in a obj file and display it.</br>
Very much in progress.</br>
Uses painters algorithm, no z buffers :(.</br>
100% spaghetti code. Not cleaned up at all, also not sure what final form will be. </br>
May become library you instantiate with an object, or some other </br>
